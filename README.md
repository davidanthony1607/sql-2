CONCLUSION: The database system designed for managing student records offers an efficient, scalable, and reliable way to track students, their courses, and grades. By structuring the data across three key tables (students, courses, enrollments), the system ensures data integrity through foreign key constraints and simplifies data retrieval using SQL JOIN queries.
